What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

  The projects in this course all revolved around efficiently manipulating data held in a CSV file. 
  Through utilizing various types of data structures, I was able to see how different data structures can provide different pros and cons for different types of data and different use cases.

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

  When approaching the type of data structure that I wanted to use or the assignments in this course I had to consider how the data 
  would be manipulated and accessed and then make an educated decision on what type of data structure would be most efficient to implement

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

  When going through the activities and projects of this course I did meet a couple of roadblocks, however one of my closest friends is already a software developer and used to provide tutoring as well.
  He was an excellent source of information and tutoring when I was confused about how to achieve a solution. That, along with Google, and YouTube solved many of my issues and taught me a great deal that wasn't necessarily super obvious when reading it in the textbook.

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

  I actually feel like I learned quite a bit during this term on how to design software and develop programs. 
  I feel like I really gained an understanding of how the various sort algorithms work and why the type of data structure you'd choose to use can be a crucial choice. 
  While the data set we used in this course was relatively tiny the efficiency gains of utilizing the proper data structure cannot be understated when dealing with industrial sized data sets. 
  My work on this project also really solidified just how modular logic can be.

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

  Working on this final project definitely helped evolve the way that I write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable. 
  So much of the business logic utilized in each of the milestones was reutilized over and over again with slight tweaks. In fact, the final project was effectively 
  just the binary search tree assignment with different variable names and less functions that I had to write. This class has done a lot to make me understand just how modular and general a lot of the ideas in a computer program are when they are properly compartmentalized.
